# App_Dev_ReactNative

This repository contains my lab works for the Mobile Application Development course I took at my university. The course covered the basics of mobile app development using React Native and Expo. Each lab work is organized in a separate directory and in the practice-projects directory I also included some projects other than lab work.

## Labs
