# Mobile Application Development Labs

This repository contains my lab works for the Mobile Application Development course I took at my university. The course covered the basics of mobile app development using React Native and Expo. Each lab work is organized in a separate directory with its own README file explaining the requirements and objectives of the lab.

## Labs

Here's a list of the lab works included in this repository:

- [Lab 1: Introduction to React Native](./Lab1/)
- [Lab 2: Building a Simple Todo App](./Lab2/)
- [Lab 3: Styling and Navigation in React Native](./Lab3/)
- [Lab 4: Handling User Input and Data Persistence](./Lab4/)
- [Lab 5: Using APIs and Networking in React Native](./Lab5/)
- [Lab 6: Working with Maps and Geolocation in React Native](./Lab6/)
- [Lab 7: Debugging and Testing React Native Apps](./Lab7/)

Each lab work has its own set of requirements and objectives, and is designed to build on the knowledge and skills learned in previous labs.

The labs in this repository were developed using the following technologies:

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

## Getting Started

To run any of the lab works in this repository, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/) installed on your machine. Once you have these dependencies installed, you can navigate to the directory of the lab work you want to run and execute the following commands:

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the app
npm start
```

This will start the Expo development server and open the app on your default browser. You can then use the Expo app on your phone or an emulator to view and test the app.
