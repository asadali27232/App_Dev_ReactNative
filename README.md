# App_Dev_ReactNative

This repository contains my lab works for the Mobile Application Development course I took at my university. The course covered the basics of mobile app development using React Native and Expo. Each lab work is organized in a separate directory and in practice-projects directory I also included some projects other then lab works.

## Getting Started

To run any of the lab works in this repository, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/) installed on your machine. Once you have these dependencies installed, you can navigate to the directory of the lab work you want to run and execute the following commands:

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the app
npx expo start
```

This will start the Expo development server and open the app on your default browser. You can then use the Expo app on your phone or an emulator to view and test the app.
